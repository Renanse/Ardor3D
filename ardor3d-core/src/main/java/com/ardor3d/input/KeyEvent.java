/**
 * Describes the state of a key - either it has been pressed or it has been released. Also keeps track of which
 * character the event corresponds to - the difference between a key and a character is that a key corresponds to a
 * physical key on the keyboard, whereas the character is the character that a keypress combination represents. Keys are
 * universal and mapped into the Key enum, whereas characters can be any char value. Some examples of the differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>On almost any keyboard, pressing {@link Key#EIGHT} results in the character '8'.</li>
 * <li>On an English keyboard, pressing {@link Key#EIGHT} when the {@link Key#LSHIFT} is down leads to the character
 * '*'.</li>
 * <li>On a Swedish keyboard, pressing {@link Key#EIGHT} when the {@link Key#LSHIFT} is down leads to the character '('.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
