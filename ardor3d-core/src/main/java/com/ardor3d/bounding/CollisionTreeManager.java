/**
 * CollisionTreeManager is an automated system for handling the creation and deletion of CollisionTrees. The manager
 * maintains a cache map of currently generated collision trees. The collision system itself requests a collision tree
 * from the manager via the <code>getCollisionTree</code> method. The cache is checked for the tree, and if it is
 * available, sent to the caller. If the tree is not in the cache, and generateTrees is true, a new CollisionTree is
 * generated on the fly and sent to the caller. When a new tree is created, the cache size is compared to the
 * maxElements value. If the cache is larger than maxElements, the cache is sent to the CollisionTreeController for
 * cleaning.
 * <p>
 * There are a number of settings that can be used to control how trees are generated. First, generateTrees denotes
 * whether the manager should be creating trees at all. This is set to true by default. doSort defines if the
 * CollisionTree primitive array should be sorted as it is built. This is false by default. Sorting is beneficial for
 * model data that is not well ordered spatially. This occurrence is rare, and sorting slows creation time. It is,
 * therefore, only to be used when model data requires it. maxPrimitivesPerLeaf defines the number of primitives a leaf
 * node in the collision tree should maintain. The larger number of primitives maintained in a leaf node, the smaller
 * the tree, but the larger the number of checks during a collision. By default, this value is set to 16. maxElements
 * defines the maximum number of trees that will be maintained before clean-up is required. A collision tree is defined
 * for each mesh that is being collided with. The user should determine the optimal number of trees to maintain (a
 * memory/performance tradeoff), based on the number of meshes, their population density and their primitive size. By
 * default, this value is set to 25. The type of trees that will be generated is defined by the treeType value, where
 * valid options are define in CollisionTree as AABB_TREE, OBB_TREE and SPHERE_TREE. You can set the functionality of
 * how trees are removed from the cache by providing the manager with a CollisionTreeController implementation. By
 * default, the manager will use the UsageTreeController for removing trees, but any other CollisionTreeController is
 * acceptable. You can create protected tree manually. These are collision trees that you request the manager to create
 * and not allow them to be removed by the CollisionTreeController.
