/**
 * Methods flagged with this annotation should only be run in the main thread, that is, the thread that handles the
 * OpenGL calls. It is possible, and good during development but possibly not during production, to use a method
 * interceptor that enforces this constraint, but in any case, the presence of the annotation should help programmers
 * when thinking about threading.
 * 
 * This annotation should be used on any API method in the framework for which it is necessary to call it only from the
 * main thread. If it adds to clarity, it may be a good idea to use it for internal methods as well.
 * 
 * Note that this annotation, when present on an interface method, does not get inherited, and it is therefore there
 * only for clarity purposes rather than as a way of getting method interception to work. It should always be added to
 * any class directly implementing an interface method that uses it.
