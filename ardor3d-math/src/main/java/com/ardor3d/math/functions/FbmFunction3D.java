     * 
     * @param source
     *            the source function we will operate on.
     * @param octaves
     *            the number of iterations we will perform. Called octaves because the default for each octave is double
     *            the frequency of the previous octave, a property shared by music tones. Generally a value between 4
     *            and 8 is good.
     * @param frequency
     *            a scale value applied to the incoming tuple before we apply fBm. It is the number of cycles per unit
     *            for the function. Default would be 1.
     * @param persistence
     *            a scale value that determines how fast the amplitude decreases for each octave. Generally should be in
     *            the range [0, 1]. A lower persistence value will decrease the effect of each octave. A traditional
     *            value is 0.5
     * @param lacunarity
     *            a scale value that determines how fast the frequency increases for each octave (freq = prevFreq *
     *            lac.) A traditional value is 2.
